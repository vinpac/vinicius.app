For the payment integration, I worked as the back-end developer, where I created Lambda functions to serve as our integration bridge. It allowed us to receive R$200,000+ (Brazilian real) in March of 2020. I also worked as a back-end developer to enable our white-label features. In this role, I created a system where a platform for a client could easily overwrite parts of our app to function according to the client's needs.\n\nTo improve the development experience, I added continuous integration to improve the deployment process. The integration validated the new app version, deployed previews, and guaranteed that every client was up to date with the app core."
